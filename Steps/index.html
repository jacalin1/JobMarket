      actually have value because each person has only two of them. Though you should
      not obsess about where to send your “signals” you should give it some thought –
      if you are a plausible candidate for a job at the institution in question, they will
      deﬁnitely pay more attention to your application if they receive your “signal.” It
      will single out your application from the 400 others they will have received. They
      might receive only 10 “signals” so they can aﬀord to pay close attention to those

<!--l. 199--><p class="noindent" ><a 
 id="below"></a> One activity that does not ﬁt neatly into the chronological framework articulated above is
the process of developing the list of places you want to apply to. You should start
this process as soon as your advisor gives you preliminary approval to be on the
market. Periodically check Job Openings for Economists (JOE) (available from the
AEA) for job listings. You might also check listings from the Financial Management
Association and the National Association of Business Economists. If you are interested in
overseas jobs, look at the European JOE and the ads in the <span 
class="ecti-1200">Economist</span>. (If you
discover job listings that may be of interest to your classmates, please let them
                                                                                     
                                                                                     
know).
<!--l. 212--><p class="indent" >  You will ultimately need to generate form letters to the employers you plan to apply to, and
will need various kinds of information about them (like email addresses and phone numbers)
as you work your way through the process. Over the years, we have developed a standardized
Excel spreadsheet template that contains slots for all the information you will need to collect,
available in the <a 
href="https://github.com/llorracc/JobMarket/blob/main/Templates" ><span 
class="ectt-1200">Templates</span></a> folder as <span 
class="ectt-1200">EmployersMoniker.xls</span>. You <span 
class="ecti-1200">MUST </span>use (a
renamed version of) this Excel spreadsheet template when you send out your mailing
(because you want to use the linked form-letter-generating software); therefore, to
avoid confusing yourself by having multiple lists, you should start your process by
downloading the spreadsheet <span 
class="ectt-1200">EmployersMoniker.xls </span>from the <a 
href="https://github.com/llorracc/JobMarket/blob/main/Templates" ><span 
class="ectt-1200">Templates</span></a> directory.
Rename it to, e.g., <span 
class="ectt-1200">EmployersCarrollCD.xls</span>, erase the information that is in it
(unless you want to apply to some of the example employers included in the template
ﬁle – in which case, you still need to verify that they are hiring this year and the
contact information has remained the same). Please <span 
class="ecti-1200">do not </span>rearrange or rename
the columns in this template – in the end, the JMPO will need to merge all of the
students’ templates in order to have a manageable idea of who has applied where,
and you do not want to piss oﬀ the JMPO at this crucial time by making extra
work in the form of ﬁguring out what you have renamed columns to and where you
have moved them to. (You are welcome to add extra columns beyond those in the
template, and hide those that you don’t need to use; but do NOT rename or reorder
them!).
<!--l. 238--><p class="indent" >  When you have developed a list of places to which you wish to apply, make an appointment
with your advisor(s) to discuss the list. When you and your advisor(s) have agreed on the ﬁnal
list, you will need to give copies of the list to the people who are writing reference letters. See
<a 
href="https://github.com/llorracc/JobMarket/blob/main/RecLetters" ><span 
class="ectt-1200">RecLetters</span></a> for procedures. For academic employers, some will ask for evidence of teaching
skills; here, there is no clear-cut standard for what they expect to receive, but student
evaluations of your performance (including a few choice quotes from the student
evaluation forms) are a good idea. Do NOT send more than a page or two of info on
this subject - nobody will read more than this, so distill everything down to the
essence.
<!--l. 240--><p class="indent" >  Err on the side of too many applications rather than too few. But don’t waste
everyone’s time by applying to places that you would turn down under all possible
circumstances.
<!--l. 248--><p class="indent" >  One more point: You should have a regular computer backup plan (ideally, an
automatic backup every night; at a minimum, once a week) for all the computer
ﬁles that are critical to your thesis research, job market paper, and application
process. Without a backup, you are at risk of losing months worth of work or more,
and in a worst case scenario it could mean you will have to withdraw from the job
market. In 2003 one student’s laptop crashed right in the middle of the job market.
Fortunately the student had a week-old backup of the key ﬁles; but let that be a
warning.

<!--l. 287--><p class="indent" >  The Advice category is particularly noteworthy, as it contains (among other things) a
variety of documents speciﬁcally written by either JHU students or JHU faculty with their
personal advice about various aspects of the job market process. For example, the document

handle job market interviews.
